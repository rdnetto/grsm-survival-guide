# Background & Guiding Principles
If you're questioning or have just realised you're some flavour of queer, this guide is for you. The objective here is to provide a concise summary of terms and ideas that are likely to be useful to someone such as yourself within the first month or so of getting a grip on things and trying to make sense of yourself.

This guide is intended to be as inclusive as possible - everyone's experiences are valid, and should not be rejected purely because they are not supported by your experiences.

This also means that the guide will be SFW - any terms with strong kink associations or otherwise inappropriate for minors are out of scope.

This guide is also not intended to be exhaustive or the final word - instead, it's intended as a launching pad for terms to google. In general, if it's not immediately relevant to someone who's realised they're queer less than a month ago, it's probably not relevant.

Mental health related terms are considered in scope however, due to the high prevalance of mental health issues within our community.

# How to contribute

# Misc
Github was chosen as the hosting platform as it allows non-technical users to contribute directly from the browser, and has a lightweight account creation process to ensure that closeted folks are still able to contribute. (For this reaason, Google Docs was considered a non-option.)
